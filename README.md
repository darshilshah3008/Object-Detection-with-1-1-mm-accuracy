# Ultrasonic SONAR-Based Object Localization & Drawing Pen System

This project implements a **40 kHz ultrasonic SONAR-based localization system** capable of detecting the position of an object in 2-D space with approximately **5 mm ‚Äì 1 cm accuracy**.  
A custom **drawing pen mechanism** physically draws according to the detected coordinates.

The system continuously senses the object‚Äôs position using multiple receivers, performs triangulation, and visualizes the location on a terminal and LCD.

## üîç Software Overview

### Key Responsibilities
- Read sensor times and compute position via triangulation
- EEPROM-based persistent configuration
- User shell command interface
- Noise filtering through averaging + variance filtering
- Coordinate rendering to LCD and serial terminal
- Real-time motion output for drawing pen

### Triangulation

Coordinates are computed from time-of-flight data from multiple receivers.  
Error tolerance is ~**5 mm per axis**, depending on calibrated geometry.
